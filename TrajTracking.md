in gravity compensation: deal with oscilating torque after a harder push


check the behaviour of the motor: PD with and without compensation and PID


Trapezoidal Trajectory: check behaviour with trapezoidal traj (speed) and wit instantenious acceleration (linear trajectory of displacement)

Set boundaries to torque max values, and check trajectory (graphs, trajectory itself, compae real and theoretical behaviour)



Set some time we want to pass trajectory through, determine trapezoidal profile for velocity, knowing max speed and acceleration.
